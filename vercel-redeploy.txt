FORCE REDEPLOY: 2025-01-22-v2

This file exists solely to trigger a new Vercel deployment.
The build cache seems to be stuck and not reflecting our changes.

Expected behavior after this deployment:
- JavaScript file name should change from page-b712194984257b58.js
- "Using stream API" message should no longer appear
- New chunk upload logic should be active
